# Welcomer Discord ChatBot
> Welcomes new members in a discord server by responding to a welcome message and replying messages when pinged OR replied to through an AI!

## Dependencies: 
- [discord.js-v13-selfbot](https:/npmjs.org/discord.js-v13-selfbot)
- [delay](https://npmjs.org/delay)
- [AhniDev](https://npmjs.org/ahnidev)

## Possibly Asked Questions:
- Q: Can I recieve support for this?
- A: No. While I did make this script, I will not encourage users to violate Discord TOS, nor will I assist them further on doing so. 

- Q: How would I set this up in a private server?
- A: Fill out the config-example.json and copy the finished file to a new file named config.json

- Q: How do I get an API Key for the AhniDev wrapper?
- A: You can do so [here](https://kyra.tk) and fill out the email box, then copy the dialogue with your API Key, or screenshot it.

- Q: AhniDev is throwing (x) error or is down?
- A: Chances are the API is offline or the domain changed. (In the second case, just replace the url value in `./config.json` as needed)

### Note:
- As harmless as this UserBot is, it is still not recommended to run this as it is a TOS Violation to do so. This was made for educational reasons and to simplify welcoming users in a server where staff are busy and don't necessarily have time to welcome every single user!
